Task List:
- [ ] Input
- [ ] Algorithms
- [ ] Output (2 dfs +2 id+ 4 A*: 2 h1+2h2)
- [ ] Analysis: Generate a file with 20 random puzzles, compare across search algorithms and across heuristics.
- [ ] 1. average & total length of the solution and search paths.
- [ ] 2. average & total number of no solution.
- [ ] 3. average & total cost and execution time.
- [ ] 4. optimality of the solution path.
- [ ] Scaling Up: take the best-performing algorithm, increase the dimensions of the puzzle gradually, see how the size influences the performance
- [ ] Competition
- [ ] Demo
